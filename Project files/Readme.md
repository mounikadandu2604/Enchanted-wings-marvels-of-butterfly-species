# 🦋 Butterfly Classification Project

This is a deep learning web application that classifies butterfly species using a VGG16 model trained on a custom dataset.

## 🧠 About the Project

Butterflies are important pollinators and indicators of environmental health. However, identifying their species manually can be time-consuming and expertise-dependent.  
**Enchanted Wings** is an AI-based web app that helps classify butterfly species instantly through image uploads.

### 🎯 Objective:
To build a real-time butterfly classification system using a fine-tuned **VGG16 model** and deploy it through a Flask web app.
